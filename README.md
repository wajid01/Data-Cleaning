Data Cleaning

This repository demonstrates essential data cleaning techniques used in data science and machine learning projects. Data cleaning is a critical step in preparing raw datasets for analysis and modeling, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reliability of results.

📌 Key Concepts

Handling missing values (deletion, imputation, interpolation)

Removing duplicates and irrelevant data

Detecting and treating outliers

Data type conversions (numeric, categorical, datetime)

Handling inconsistent formats (e.g., strings, date formats)

Feature scaling & normalization

Encoding categorical variables

⚙️ Features

Step-by-step data preprocessing in Python

Practical examples using Pandas and NumPy

Visualization of missing data and outliers with Matplotlib/Seaborn

Clean, reusable functions for common cleaning tasks

📊 Example Use Case

Preparing a housing dataset by fixing missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing numerical values before applying regression models.

🛠️ Libraries Used

Pandas – Data manipulation

NumPy – Numerical operations
